            At PROOF, we’re no strangers to building with utility in mind.
            That’s why every Moonbird is also your key to our private PROOF
            Discord – where you’ll have admittance to our gated Parliament
            channels. Once inside, you will have exclusive access to
            Moonbird-related drops, Parliament meetups and IRL events, and
            access to upcoming PROOF projects; including the PROOF metaverse,
            codenamed Highrise.
