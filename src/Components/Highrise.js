            Moonbirds is brought to you by PROOF; the team behind the PROOF
            Collective and Grails. Our next project, codenamed Highrise is a
            focused and novel take on the metaverse. The metaverse is an
            increasingly crowded space, but built correctly, has great promise
            for connection and community. The PROOF-built metaverse will be a
            dramatic departure from the existing 'never-ending' worlds that feel
            like a digital ghost town. Ours is uniquely different, and you'll
            have first access as a nested Moonbirds holder. The Moonbirds mint
            is the beginning.
