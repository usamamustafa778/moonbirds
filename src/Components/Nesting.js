              Nesting your Moonbird
            </h1>
            Moonbirds come with a unique PFP design that allows them to be
            locked up and nested without leaving your wallet. As soon as your
            Moonbird is nested, they’ll begin to accrue additional benefits. As
            total nested time accumulates, you’ll see your Moonbird achieve new
            tier levels, upgrading their nest. Upgraded nests enable enhanced
            drops and rewards.
